# Job Scrapers Update Summary

## Overview
Updated all job scrapers in the `companies/` directory to include job descriptions in addition to the existing data (job title, location, link, and posted time).

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Job Description Extraction Function
All scrapers now include a `extract_job_description()` function that:
- Visits individual job pages
- Uses multiple CSS selectors to find job description content
- Handles errors gracefully and returns "Description not available" if extraction fails
- Supports both class-based and function-based scraper architectures

### 2. Updated Data Structure
All job data dictionaries now include:
- `job_title`: Job title
- `job_location`: Job location
- `job_link`: Link to the job posting
- `job_description`: Extracted job description
- `job_posted_at`: Timestamp when the job was scraped

## Technical Details

### Job Description Extraction Strategy
The extraction function uses multiple CSS selectors to find job descriptions:
```python
description_selectors = [
    "div[data-testid='job-description']",
    ".job-description",
    ".description",
    "[class*='description']",
    "[class*='content']",
    "section",
    "article",
    ".job-details",
    "[data-testid='job-details']",
    ".job-content",
    ".job-summary",
    ".job-requirements",
    ".job-responsibilities"
]
```

### Error Handling
- Each scraper creates a separate browser instance for description extraction
- Graceful fallback to "Description not available" if extraction fails
- Timeout handling for slow-loading pages
- Minimum content length validation (50 characters) to ensure meaningful descriptions

### Performance Considerations
- Description extraction adds time to the scraping process
- Each job requires an additional page visit
- Consider implementing parallel processing for large job lists
- May need to add delays between requests to avoid rate limiting

## Usage

The scrapers now return job data in this format:
```json
{
  "company": "company_name",
  "data": [
    {
      "job_title": "Software Engineer",
      "job_location": "San Francisco, CA",
      "job_link": "https://company.com/job/123",
      "job_description": "We are looking for a software engineer...",
      "job_posted_at": "2024-01-15 10:30:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `update_scrapers.py`: Script to automatically update all scrapers
- `fix_scrapers.py`: Script to fix common issues in updated scrapers
- `README_UPDATES.md`: This documentation file

### Modified Files:
- All 30 scraper files in the `companies/` directory

## Testing

To test the updated scrapers:
1. Run individual scrapers: `python3 companies/amazon.py`
2. Run the main application: `python3 main.py`
3. Check the output JSON to verify job descriptions are included

## Notes

- Some scrapers may take longer to run due to additional page visits
- Job descriptions may vary in quality and completeness depending on the source website
- Consider implementing caching to avoid re-scraping descriptions for the same jobs
- Monitor for rate limiting and adjust delays as needed
